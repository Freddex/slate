# Node

The `Node` union type represents all of the different types of nodes that occur in a Slate document tree.

```typescript
type Node = Editor | Element | Text
```

## Editor

The `Editor` object stores all the state of a slate editor. It can be extended by plugins to add helpers and implement new behaviors.

```typescript
interface Editor {
  children: Node[]
  selection: Range | null
  operations: Operation[]
  marks: Record<string, any> | null
  [key: string]: any

  // Schema-specific node behaviors.
  isInline: (element: Element) => boolean
  isVoid: (element: Element) => boolean
  normalizeNode: (entry: NodeEntry) => void
  onChange: () => void

  // Overrideable core actions.
  addMark: (key: string, value: any) => void
  apply: (operation: Operation) => void
  deleteBackward: (unit: 'character' | 'word' | 'line' | 'block') => void
  deleteForward: (unit: 'character' | 'word' | 'line' | 'block') => void
  deleteFragment: () => void
  insertBreak: () => void
  insertFragment: (fragment: Node[]) => void
  insertNode: (node: Node) => void
  insertText: (text: string) => void
  removeMark: (key: string) => void
}
```

### Instance methods

#### Schema-specific actions

###### `isInline(element: Element)`

Check if a value is an inline `Element` object.

###### `isVoid(element: Element)`

Check if a value is a void `Element` object.

###### `normalizeNode(entry: NodeEntry)`

Normalize a Node according to the schema.

###### `onChange()`

#### Core actions

###### `addMark(key: string, value: any)`

Add a custom property to the leaf text nodes in the current selection. If the selection is currently collapsed, the marks will be added to the `editor.marks` property instead, and applied when text is inserted next.

###### `removeMark(key: string)`

Remove a custom property from the leaf text nodes in the current selection.

###### `deleteBackward(options?: {unit?: 'character' | 'word' | 'line' | 'block'})`

Delete content in the editor backward from the current selection.

###### `deleteForward(options?: {unit?: 'character' | 'word' | 'line' | 'block'})`

Delete content in the editor forward from the current selection.

###### `insertFragment(fragment: Node[])`

Insert a fragment at the current selection. If the selection is currently expanded, delete it first.

###### `deleteFragment()`

Delete the content of the current selection.

###### `insertBreak()`

Insert a block break at the current selection. If the selection is currently expanded, delete it first.

###### `insertNode(node: Node)`

Insert a node at the current selection. If the selection is currently expanded, delete it first.

###### `insertText(text: string)`

Insert text at the current selection. If the selection is currently expanded, delete it first.

###### `apply(operation: Operation)`

Apply an operation in the editor.

## Element

`Element` objects are a type of node in a Slate document that contain other `Element` nodes or `Text` nodes. They can be either "blocks" or "inlines" depending on the Slate editor's configuration.

```typescript
interface Element {
  children: Node[]
  [key: string]: any
}
```

### 

## Text

`Text` objects represent the nodes that contain the actual text content of a Slate document along with any formatting properties. They are always leaf nodes in the document tree as they cannot contain any children.

```typescript
interface Text {
    text: string,
    [key: string]: any
}
```
